This integrated setup enables you to monitor infrastructure and application health effectively.


## Prerequisites

Before using this role, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Ansible installed on your control node.

2. SSH access to the target servers with the necessary permissions.

3. A compatible Linux distribution on your target servers (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).

4. Correctly configured AWS Dynamic Inventory or custom inventory.

5. AWS credentials or appropriate IAM roles for accessing EC2 instances (if applicable).

# RolesOverview

This Ansible role includes tasks for:

- Installing and configuring Grafana for visualizing data and metrics.
- Installing and configuring Prometheus as the monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- Installing and configuring Node Exporter for collecting server metrics.

By using this role, you can streamline the setup and management of monitoring tools in your infrastructure.
